ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* default.properties
* deploy.sh
* pom.xml
* resources/
* resources/i-jetty-logo-green.svg
* resources/i-jetty-logo.svg
* resources/ijetty_icon.svg
* resources/ijetty_icon_abstract.svg
* resources/ijetty_icon_abstract_2.svg
* resources/ijetty_icon_abstract_3.svg
* resources/ijetty_icon_abstract_4.svg
* resources/ijetty_icon_abstract_5.svg
* resources/ijetty_icon_abstract_6.svg
* resources/ijetty_icon_i_dot_j.svg
* resources/ijetty_icon_i_in_j_start.svg
* resources/ijetty_icon_i_j.svg
* resources/ijetty_icon_i_j_colon.svg
* resources/ijetty_icon_j_start.svg
* resources/ijetty_icon_simple.svg
* resources/ijetty_stat.svg
* resources/jetty-logo.svg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* src/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/.DS_Store
* src/org/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/org/.DS_Store
* src/org/mortbay/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/org/mortbay/.DS_Store
* src/org/mortbay/ijetty/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/org/mortbay/ijetty/.DS_Store
* src/org/mortbay/ijetty/handler/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/org/mortbay/ijetty/handler/.DS_Store
* src/org/mortbay/ijetty/util/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/org/mortbay/ijetty/util/.DS_Store

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
